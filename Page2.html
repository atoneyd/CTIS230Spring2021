    <h3>Good Country People</h3>
    <p class="background">“Good Country People” takes place in the rural south, and although the exact location is never
        specified, it would be safe to assume that the setting is O’Connor’s home state of Georgia
        given the context of her life and her other works. The story also presumably occurs during
        the 1950s, when it was published. Mrs. Hopewell is content with her life on the farm and
        enjoys the company of the “good country people” around her. However, she is shown to be
        quite misguided in her judgments, especially in her view of Manley. The good country people
        who are “the salt of the earth” are more complex than Mrs. Hopewell makes them out to be
        (O’Connor 7). Joy, who unlike her mother feels disdain for “good country people,” is also
        unable to see the signs that she had been lied to by Manley, as her judgment is clouded by
        her superiority complex. There are many symbols closely related to Joy that paint her to be
        a vulnerable character and an easy target for Manley’s scheme.</p>

    <h3>Wooden Leg Symbolism</h3>
    <p class="items">The wooden leg that Joy wears is an important symbol that appears very often in the story.
        For Joy, it is something she is dependent on and can’t function normally without it. Her mother
        views the loss of her original leg as the reason for Joy’s miserable and rude personality. As
        the thing that ultimately gets taken from her by Manley, the wooden leg is a very prominent
        symbol in the story. It is something that she is reluctant to show to him, and when she finally
        does it represents her putting a trust in him that she has never given to anyone else. Her leg
        is something that makes her vulnerable, shown by her dependence on him once it’s taken off and
        her inability to escape after he’s stolen it. The stealing of the leg is part of the dramatic
        shift in the story when Manley reveals that he’s not what he’s made himself out to be. The leg
        represents Joy’s personality and how she views that she is distinct from the rest of the
        characters and above them intellectually. It is so integral to her identity that “she took care
        of it as someone else would his soul” (O’Connor 14). And just as she is physically vulnerable,
        her intellect is flawed and ultimately contributes to her downfall, as she is deluded by the idea
        that Manley is just “good country people,” and someone that she can manipulate with ease. She
        surrenders her wooden leg, and all the time she spent working towards a Ph.D. could not mentally
        prepare her for what Manley would do.</p>

    <h3>Glasses Symbolism</h3>
    <p class="items">While not as important, Joy’s glasses are a symbol that plays a similar role to her wooden leg,
        as both are items that she uses for support and depends on to go about her daily life. Along
        with her weak heart and wooden leg, the glasses contribute to Joy’s physical vulnerability, which
        carries over mentally despite her thinking her mind is superior to others. Manley first takes off
        her glasses in the barn, showing how he is slowly taking control away from Joy and gaining her trust.
        Just as he compliments her leg by saying “it’s what makes you different,” he says to Joy earlier in
        the story, “I like girls that wear glasses” (O’Connor 11). He mentions these things to pretend that
        he admires her and puts her in a more vulnerable position, while further solidifying that he is
        “good country people” from her perspective. She is thoroughly deceived by his words and thinks
        she is “face to face with real innocence,” and believes that he “had touched the truth about her”
        (O’Connor 14).</p>
