        <h1>American Gothic: The Art of Flannery O’Connor’s Literature</h1>
        <h2><em>Page 3</em></h2>

        <h3>Briefcase Symbolism</h3>
        <p>Additionally, Manley’s briefcase is representative of his questionable character and what 
        he hides. A first glance at the inside shows the Bibles Manley is supposedly selling, an 
        innocent facade masking his actual intentions. He uses this fake persona of being “just a 
        country boy” to gain the trust of Mrs. Hopewell and, eventually, Joy (O’Connor 7). A closer 
        look into his valise reveals that the Bibles are fake, and inside one of them is “a pocket 
        flask of whiskey, a pack of cards, and a small blue box with printing on it” (O’Connor 15). 
        The briefcase symbolizes the hypocrisy of Manley selling Bibles and claiming to be Christian. 
        The true purpose of the briefcase is revealed along with Manley’s true character, in a dramatic 
        shift in the story where Hulga realizes he is not good country people. When she questions him, 
        saying “aren’t you just good country people?” she murmurs and her voice “had an almost pleading 
        sound” (O’Connor 15). This is a stark contrast to the arrogant and headstrong character that 
        Joy is shown to be at the beginning of the story.</p>
        
        <h3>Character Names Symbolism</h3>
        <p>Another important source of symbolism lies within the names that O’Connor chose for her characters. 
        The character Manley Pointer notably has a double meaning behind his name, being a crude joke 
        that points to his unpleasant true nature, a hint that he is not the nice man that he appears 
        to be. This is also an example of O’Connor’s humor within her writing. We also eventually come 
        to learn that along with the rest of Manley’s persona, his name is fake as well. Mrs. Freeman’s 
        name indicates that there is a sort of freedom in being just “good country people,” instead of 
        being weighed down by the philosophies that Joy studies. There is some irony in the fact that 
        Mrs. Freeman works for Mrs. Hopewell, so in that sense she is not completely free, which may also 
        be a part of O’Connor’s incorporation of humor into the story. Nevertheless, Mrs. Freeman has her 
        own principles and is a free thinker who “could never be brought to admit herself wrong to any 
        point” (O’Connor 2).</p>

        <p>There is also Mrs. Hopewell, whose last name points to her hopefulness and trust that good 
        country people are just that. Throughout the story, she is shown to be someone optimistic, who 
        likes to say things like “nothing is perfect” or “that is life” (O’Connor 3) However, she still 
        believes herself to be better than the “good country people” that she adores, evidenced in how 
        she feels she can determine who is really “good country people” and who is “trash” (O’Connor 2).</p>
