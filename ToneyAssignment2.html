    <h3 id="introheader">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="intro">Flannery O’Connor, a prominent writer of the Southern Gothic style,
        crafted unique stories filled with dark humor and grotesque twists.
        These characteristics are particularly evident in her short story “Good Country People.”
        Through her use of symbols and Southern Gothic sensibilities, Flannery O’Connor
        successfully demonstrates that “good country people” are, in fact, hard to find.</p>

    <h3>O'Connor's Background</h3>
    <p class="background">It is essential to look at O’Connor’s stories within the context of her life and upbringing.
        She grew up in Georgia, obtaining her B.A. in sociology and English literature from Georgia
        College at 20, and was a year later accepted into the esteemed Iowa Writers’ Workshop at the
        University of Iowa where she would earn her M.F.A. Her writing is heavily influenced by her
        upbringing in Georgia as well as her Roman Catholic faith. Subsequently, many of her stories
        take place in Georgia and her works often had religious themes and parallels from her life
        experiences. When she was young, her father was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus,
        an autoimmune disease that would eventually cause his death when she was 15. O’Connor herself
        would later be diagnosed with the same disease in 1950 when she was 25, with an estimated five
        more years to live (“Flannery O'Connor”). Her father’s lupus caused their family to move to a
        farm in Milledgeville, Georgia, where she and her mother continued to live after his death,
        and where O’Connor would return after her own diagnosis.</p>

    <h3>Influences on Writing</h3>
    <p class="background">The significance of O’Connor’s lupus reveals itself in her writing. In 1955 she published a
        short story collection titled <em>A Good Man is Hard to Find.</em> Within this collection is the
        short story “Good Country People,” whose main character, Joy, is plagued by “a weak heart.”
        Her condition, which parallels O’Connor’s lupus, shortens her life and prevents her from
        being “far from these red hills” and the good country people she looks down upon. The
        disease hinders her aspirations as an intellectual, and Joy claims that if she were
        free from her condition, she would be “in a university lecturing to people who knew what
        she was talking about” (O’Connor 5). O’Connor spent the last 14 years of her life grappling
        with her diagnosis, which contributed to dark themes of death and disaster in this story and in
        the bulk of her writing. Her struggle with a terminal illness is shown in Joy, who is also an
        embodiment of O’Connor that goes beyond the similarity in disease.</p>
